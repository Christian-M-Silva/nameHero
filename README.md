## Overview

### The objectives

- Create an API where you can register, delete, view and update a hero name and secret identity

### How to run the project
  After downloading the application to your machine, run it in the terminal:
  ```bash
    npm i 
    # or:
    yarn
  ```

  After successful installation of all packages, run in terminal:
  ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # or:
    yarn dev
  ```

  **Go to the env file and make the necessary settings. By default this project is in mongo, if you change the database, go to *APP >> CONFIG >> DATABASE* and change the connection to the desired database, don't forget to download the right package, see more in the adonis documentation.**

  **Open [http://127.0.0.1:3333/user](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. Possible errors caused by changes can be seen in the console.**
